# Project Summary: Portfolio Tracker

This document provides a summary of the work done on the portfolio tracker backend and frontend, and outlines the next steps for the development team.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio tracking service that can be integrated into an existing website. The backend is responsible for managing portfolio data, fetching market prices, and providing an API for the frontend. A frontend application has also been created to serve as a presentation layer and a reference implementation.

## What has been done

### Backend

*   **Project Structure:** A FastAPI backend has been set up with a clear project structure, separating concerns like API endpoints, services, and database models.
*   **Database:** The backend is configured to connect to a Supabase PostgreSQL database. The database schema has been defined using SQLAlchemy, and the tables have been created.
*   **Market Data:** A service has been implemented to fetch real-time market data from Yahoo Finance.
*   **API:** A FastAPI application has been created with the following endpoint:
    *   `GET /api/portfolios/{portfolio_id}`: Fetches the summary of a portfolio, including its holdings and their current market value.
*   **Sample Data:** The database has been seeded with a sample portfolio and holdings for demonstration and testing purposes.

### Frontend

*   **Project Structure:** A React application has been created in the `frontend` directory using Vite.
*   **Styling:** The frontend has been set up with Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Components:** React components have been created to display the portfolio summary and a table of holdings.
*   **API Integration:** The frontend fetches data from the backend API and displays it.

## How to run the project

### Backend

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials.
3.  **Run the server:** From the `backend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
    ```

### Frontend

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    
    
    ```
The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## API Documentation

The backend API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at:
[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Current Status and Known Issues

The backend is functional and the frontend has been developed to display the data. However, the frontend is currently rendering a blank page due to a persistent `SyntaxError`. This issue seems to be related to the local development environment and how JavaScript modules are being handled.

## Next Steps

### For the user running this project:

*   **Resolve the frontend issue:** The immediate next step is to resolve the blank page issue on the frontend. As we have exhausted the debugging steps that can be performed remotely, it is recommended to seek help from a colleague or to start the frontend project from a clean slate.

### For the Frontend Team:

Once the rendering issue is resolved, the frontend can be further developed:

*   **Improve the UI/UX:** Enhance the design and user experience of the portfolio tracker.
*   **Add interactivity:** Implement features like sorting the holdings table or clicking on a holding to see more details.
*   **Prepare for integration:** Package the frontend as a reusable component or set of components that can be easily integrated into the main website.

### For the Backend Team:

The current backend implementation provides a read-only view of a single portfolio. The following features need to be implemented next:

*   **CRUD operations for portfolios and holdings.**
*   **User authentication and authorization.**
*   **Transaction tracking and realised gains calculation.**
*   **Historical performance data for charts.**
